## Goals

We strive to create a convenient website where non-R users and the general public can navigate to and customize the several famous art pieces recreated in ggplot. Users will have the ability to adjust and modify some of the artwork aesthetics to make the masterworks their own. 

Our goal is to promote digital extensions of modern, abstract paintings and encourage users to  play with and modify pieces with significance and status in the art world. Wealthy collectors, curators, and gallery owners have historically had a massive amount of power in determining what is considered “good art” and what sells. We see our project as part of the move to question empty status designations and push back against institutional art gatekeeping. We will do this by creating a convenient website where users can access several examples of recreated art pieces and adjust their aesthetics based on one’s personal preference and download them for their personal use. 

In addition, our motivation is also to increase public appreciation and awareness on the advent of using digital techniques to recreate modern or postmodern artworks and help spark the tech community's interest in contributing to R by developing and creating more R packages (especially in generative art and ggplot). We hope that our work will contribute positively to widen up the usage of R not only to statisticians and data scientists, but also to digital designers and professionals outside of the field of statistics/data.

We are going to use fake datasets, mathematical functions, and “ready-to-use” packages to recreate art pieces in ggplot.
