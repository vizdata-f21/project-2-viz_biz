In this folder, Phillip will include his work on Frank Stella's art piece [***Lettre Sur Les Et Muets II***](https://nsuartmuseum.org/exhibition/frank-stella-experiment-and-change/).
Born in 1936, Frank Stella is an American painter noted for his works in the areas of minimalism and post-painterly abstraction genres.

Painted in 1974, *Lettre Sur Les Et Muets II* (1974) was one of his synthetic polymer paint on canvas and is currently housed in the NSU Art Museum.

The painting's symmetrical and easily identifiable features are what attracts us to recreate a visualization of this masterpiece. 4 distinct features spark our interest. We also believe that these features should be made *adjustable/modifiable* to the preference of each audience:

1. **Number of layers**: In the original painting, there are 12 layers of colored-gradient rectangles and 11 layers of black-and-white-gradient rectangles (23 layers in total), alternating against one another. We would like the audience to be able to determine how many layers do they want to have in total in their final piece of art, depending on the purpose of usage (small/nightstand or big/wall decorations).

- ***Approach:*** We will use the 'slider input' Shiny widget in the UI interface. `sliderInput(inputId = "size", label = "Size:", min = 10, max = 50, value = 20)` In the server, the input 'size' will and integral component to create the dataframe that will be used in the plotting process. `n <- reactive({input$size * 2})`

2. **Primary color sequence**: The original painting uses a rainbow-gradient color sequence as part of its 12 layers of colored-gradient rectangles. For the recreated visualization, the audience will be able to change this through adjusting the color palette and decide whether or not to reverse the direction of the color sequence.

3. **Secondary color sequence**: The original painting uses a black-and-white-gradient color sequence as part of its 11 layers of non-colored-gradient rectangles. For the recreated visualization, the audience will be able to change this through adjusting the color palette and decide whether or not to reverse the direction of the color sequence.

4. **Borderline**: We've noticed that the original artwork contains a thin white borderlines between each of the rectangle layers. We believe that some of our audience like this feature but not all, hence, we make it an option for the audience to preserve or remove the borderlines in their final plot.

- ***Approach:*** We will use the 'switch input' Shiny widget in the UI interface to turn on/off the borderline. `switchInput(inputId = "borderline", label = "Borderlines", value = FALSE)` In the server, the reactive input 'borderline' will be part of the aesthetic in the ggplot. `geom_polygon(..., size = borderline())`
